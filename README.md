This is for me to learn GitHub
Hello future Gael,
This is present Gael. I guess past Gael for you. As we are both present Gael but in separate worlds. But I digress. Hopefully when you read this again you'll be a wiser version. Don't forget to be happy, stop and smell the roses. They'll be gone tomorrow. 
I love you man,
Best wishes,
Gael
